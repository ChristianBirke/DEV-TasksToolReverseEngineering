## üéØ UML Fundamentals

### What are UML Use Case Diagrams?
UML (Unified Modeling Language) use case diagrams focus on **what** a system does from the user's perspective, rather than **how** it does it. They capture functional requirements by showing:

- **Actors**: Who or what interacts with the system
- **Use Cases**: What functionality the system provides
- **Relationships**: How actors and use cases connect
- **System Boundaries**: What's inside vs outside the system scope

### Key Differences from Technical Flowcharts
| Aspect | Technical Flowcharts | UML Use Case Diagrams |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | How the system works internally | What the system does for users |
| **Audience** | Developers, architects | Business analysts, stakeholders |
| **Level** | Implementation details | Functional requirements |
| **Purpose** | Technical design | Requirements gathering |

## üîó Relationship Patterns

### Include Relationships (<<include>>)
**Meaning**: Base use case always includes the sub-use case

#### Common Patterns in Vectal:
- **Create Task includes Add Task Context**: Every task creation requires context
- **Upload Document includes Extract Document Text**: Every upload requires text extraction
- **Execute Web Search includes Formulate Search Strategy**: Every search needs strategy

#### Implementation Guidance:
- Sub-use case must be implemented for base use case to work
- Design sub-use case as reusable component
- Error in sub-use case prevents base use case completion

### Extend Relationships (<<extend>>)
**Meaning**: Extension use case conditionally enhances the base use case

#### Common Patterns in Vectal:
- **Create Task extends to Breakdown Complex Task**: Only complex tasks trigger breakdown
- **Query Document extends to Summarize Document**: Summaries are optional enhancement
- **Monitor Agent extends to Approve Agent Actions**: Approval only needed for certain actions

#### Implementation Guidance:
- Extension use case is optional feature
- Base use case works without extension
- Extension triggered by specific conditions or user choice

### Generalization Relationships
**Meaning**: Specialized use cases inherit from general use case

#### Common Patterns in Vectal:
- **Control Agent** generalizes to Pause Agent, Resume Agent, Stop Agent
- **Query Document** generalizes to Answer Questions, Summarize, Extract Insights
- **Manage Infrastructure** generalizes to Deploy Services, Scale Resources

#### Implementation Guidance:
- Implement general use case as base functionality
- Specialized use cases add specific behavior
- Share common interface and behavior patterns
