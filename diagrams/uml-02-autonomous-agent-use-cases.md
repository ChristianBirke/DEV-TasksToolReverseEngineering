## Use Case Specifications

### Primary Use Cases

#### 1. Define Agent Goal
- **Actor**: Agent User
- **Goal**: Set up an autonomous agent with a specific high-level objective
- **Preconditions**: User has Infinite Thinking access
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User provides high-level goal description
  2. System analyzes goal complexity and feasibility
  3. User configures agent parameters and constraints
  4. System validates goal definition
  5. Agent is initialized and ready for activation

#### 2. Monitor Agent Progress
- **Actor**: Agent User
- **Goal**: Track autonomous agent activity and progress toward goal
- **Preconditions**: Agent is active or has activity history
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User accesses agent monitoring dashboard
  2. System displays real-time agent status
  3. User reviews current activities and progress
  4. System provides activity logs and updates
  5. User can drill into specific agent actions

#### 3. Control Agent Operations
- **Actor**: Agent User
- **Goal**: Manage agent execution (pause, resume, stop)
- **Preconditions**: Agent exists in system
- **Main Flow**:
  1. User selects agent control action
  2. System executes control command
  3. Agent responds to control signal
  4. System confirms control action result
  5. Agent state updated accordingly

#### 4. Review Agent Results

  1. Agent analyzes goal requirements and constraints
  2. Agent breaks down goal into actionable steps
  3. Agent creates prioritized task queue
  4. Agent identifies required tools and resources
  5. Agent establishes success criteria and milestones

#### 6. Execute Actions
- **Actor**: Autonomous Agent
- **Goal**: Perform specific actions to advance toward goal
- **Trigger**: Continuous background processing

  2. Agent performs think-act cycle for action
  3. Agent executes action using available tools
  4. Agent evaluates action results
  5. Agent updates progress and plans next steps

#### 7. Perform Think-Act Cycle
- **Actor**: Autonomous Agent
- **Goal**: Continuously reason about current state and determine next actions
- **Trigger**: Ongoing agent operations
- **Main Flow**:

- **Monitor Agent includes View Agent Logs**: Monitoring requires access to activity logs

### Extend Relationships
- **Define Goal extends to Refine Goal**: Users can iteratively improve goal definitions
- **Execute Actions extends to Access External Tools**: Agents use external tools when needed
- **Monitor Agent extends to Approve Agent Actions**: Some actions may require user approval
- **Think-Act Cycle extends to Maintain Context**: Agents preserve long-term memory

### Generalization Relationships
- **Control Agent** generalizes to specific control actions (Pause, Resume, Stop)

## Business Value

### Key Differentiators
- **True Autonomy**: 24/7 operation without constant supervision
- **Goal-Oriented**: Focused on achieving specific objectives
- **Continuous Learning**: Agents improve through experience
- **User Control**: Full transparency and intervention capabilities

### User Benefits
- **Productivity Multiplication**: Agents work while users focus on other tasks
