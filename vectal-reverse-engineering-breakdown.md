| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.1 | Key Objectives |  | Not Started |
| 1.1.1 | Streamline Task Management: Unite tasks, notes, and goals in one system enhanced by AI (no need to switch between apps). |  | Not Started |
| 1.1.2 | Autonomous Task Execution: Enable AI agents to work 24 / 7 on user‑defined tasks and goals without constant supervision. |  | Not Started |
| 1.1.3 | Personalized Productivity: Adapt to each user's context and data (e.g., user documents, preferences) for tailored assistance. |  | Not Started |
| 1.1.4 | Seamless UI / UX: Provide a clear, intuitive interface combining a to‑do list style organizer with an AI chat assistant, minimizing friction for the user. |  | Not Started |
| 1.1.5 | Trustworthy Performance: Utilize best‑in‑class AI models for accuracy and large‑context understanding, while maintaining data security and user control. |  | Not Started |
| 2.1 | Autonomous AI Agent ("Infinite Thinking") |  | Not Started |
| 2.1.1 | *Example*: A user can input a goal like **"Launch a product website next week."** The Infinite Thinking agent will brainstorm a checklist (buy domain, design landing page, write content, set up email list, etc.), then start tackling these items autonomously (e.g., drafting copy, researching competitors). The user can monitor progress or refine the goal while the agent constantly thinks and works. |  | Not Started |
| 2.1.2 | *Uniqueness*: The Infinite Thinking feature is unique to Vectal and not available in standard AI chatbots. It effectively functions as a virtual project assistant, persistently making progress without needing repeated prompts. |  | Not Started |
| 2.1.3 | *User Controls*: Users activate Infinite Thinking mode by providing a task / goal description. They can pause or stop the agent at any time. The interface shows status updates or subtasks as the agent works (e.g., "Researching domain options…", "Drafting landing‑page content…"). |  | Not Started |
| 2.1.4 | *Technical Notes*: The continuous agent uses long‑context AI models to maintain awareness of prior steps and the overall objective. The system employs a task‑queue or workflow engine to iterate the agent's think‑act cycle until the goal is met. |  | Not Started |
| 2.2 | Intelligent Task Management and Prioritization |  | Not Started |
| 2.2.1 | Automatic Task Breakdown: When a complex task is entered, Vectal's AI can suggest breaking it into smaller subtasks (e.g., "Write quarterly report" → "Gather sales data," "Draft introduction," …). |  | Not Started |
| 2.2.2 | Prioritization and Scheduling: Vectal's agent analyzes task context—deadlines, dependencies, user goals—and can prioritize and schedule tasks accordingly, highlighting important items and proposing optimal workflows. |  | Not Started |
| 2.2.3 | Contextualization: Each task can carry context (notes, links, attached docs) that the AI uses for better assistance. The agent remembers related information from the user's workspace or previous chats. |  | Not Started |
| 2.2.4 | Goal Tracking: Users can designate tasks as long‑term goals or projects; Vectal tracks progress and displays completion status ("You're 70 % done with Project X"). |  | Not Started |
| 2.2.5 | Analytics and Insights: Basic workflow analytics identify bottlenecks, track weekly completions, and surface productivity insights to the user. |  | Not Started |
| 2.3 | Integrated AI Chat Interface |  | Not Started |
| 2.3.1 | Context‑Aware Brainstorming: The chat is aware of the user's current tasks and context, tailoring answers accordingly. |  | Not Started |
| 2.3.2 | Multi‑Turn Conversations: Natural dialogue lets users refine questions or dive deeper over several turns. |  | Not Started |
| 2.3.3 | Command Execution: Users can issue commands in chat (e.g., "Mark Task Y done") and the AI updates the workspace. |  | Not Started |
| 2.3.4 | Embedded Results: AI‑generated outputs (emails, code, summaries) appear directly in chat threads for review. |  | Not Started |
| 2.3.5 | Chat Histories: Vectal stores past conversations so users can revisit and continue previous sessions. |  | Not Started |
| 2.4 | Personalized AI Chips (New in v57) |  | Not Started |

| 2.4.2 | Functionality: Chips may bundle datasets or fine‑tuning instructions so the agent produces more tailored outputs. |  | Not Started |
| 2.4.3 | UI Integration: Users create and toggle chips in a dedicated settings area; chips appear as small badges that can be enabled for specific tasks or chats. |  | Not Started |
